# 🦠 COVID-19 Analysis Using SQL

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is an **exploratory analysis** of global COVID-19 data using **SQL**, aimed at applying fundamental SQL skills to analyze real-world data. The data covers the period from **February 24, 2020 to April 30, 2021**, focusing on **cases**, **deaths**, and **vaccinations** across various countries.

- ✅ Performed on: **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- 📅 Data Source: [Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## 🧾 Datasets Used

The original dataset was split into two parts using Excel for clarity:

1. **CovidDeaths** – contains data on cases and deaths.
2. **CovidVaccinations** – contains data on vaccinations and testing.

## 🧠 Key SQL Queries & Insights

### 🔍 Query 1: Daily Impact in India
- **Objective**: Fetch total daily cases, deaths, and calculate the **daily death rate** in India.

### 🌍 Query 2: Global COVID Summary
- **Objective**: Show each country's population, total cases, total deaths, and calculate:
